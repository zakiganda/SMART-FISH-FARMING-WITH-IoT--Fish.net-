# SMART-FISH-FARMING-WITH-IoT-Fish.net-

This project is a new idea for this Integrated Developed Project which the main focus 
is on the agriculture industry. The project called Smart Fish Farming with IoT will maintain 
the water quality of the pond and monitor the water level of the fish pond. In this project, 
several systems have been proposed before starting to be implemented in the prototype. After 
the consultation of clients in the fish industry the finalised function of the system has been 
made. In order to make a system that will be reasonable and acceptable, some functions were 
revised a lot. The focus of this semester is to deliver a negligible rational product and system 
capable of performing fundamental functionalities of the proposed title. The engineeringoriented capstone design of computer and communication systems engineering is the most 
important part of project design, which includes market research, project preparation and 
implementation, modelling and simulation, cost estimation, prototype fabrication, and testing.
The purpose of this Integrated Developed Project is to help the fish farmer owner that 
faces challenges in producing a quality fish to be marketed. It is also to assist them in 
monitoring the fish pond and also maintain the water quality that can produce a better fish. 
Thus, it can prevent the fish from any disease that happens because of the dirty water or a bad 
lifestyle. The automated system is useful as it will automatically take an action toward the 
problem such as pH being too acidic.
The project began with surveys and interviews with clients in the fish farm industry. 
The targeted clients are the one who produces fish that can be eaten by humans and the 
production is on a large scale. The interviews help in checking on our objectives and function 
of the system to ensure that the work is on the necessary functionality that could be suitable for 
the user. It determines the most appropriate response approach that can be connected to aspects 
such as the fish pond environment and characteristics of water quality that fish should be living 
on. It ensures in achieving customer’s expectations, increase the profit and strengthen the 
product’s satisfaction in the market by gaining the real customers' feedback. There are a total 
of three clients that have been approached for this project which are, Taman Pertanian 
Universiti (TPU, UPM), AR Aqua and The Aquaculture Research Center (The ARC, Sungai 
Buloh). The team was able to gain a better understanding of market demand by engaging with 
the genuine clients. As a result, the quality of our products and, more significantly, the 
satisfaction of our customers are increased
